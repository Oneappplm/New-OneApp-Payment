                        Credentials verification is a critical process mandated by federal and state laws and various accreditation bodies such as NCQA, URAC, the Joint Commission, and CMS. Healthcare providers must undergo initial verification upon enrollment and subsequent reviews every two to three years. Recent requirements also necessitate continuous monitoring and practice evaluation. Verification involves validating practitioner credentials against primary sources like State License Boards, NPDB, OIG, and DEA, alongside collecting insurance certificates, peer references, and affiliations.

                        The majority of healthcare organizations perform these tasks manually, resulting in time-consuming and expensive processes. Credentialing costs can average $500 per event, with verification activities comprising a substantial portion of these expenses. As credentialing requirements have expanded, specialized staff now handle these tasks, increasing operational costs.

                            Every healthcare provider within a network or practicing at affiliated organizations like hospitals, surgery centers, nursing homes, and home health agencies must undergo credentialing. Credentialing involves acquiring, verifying, and maintaining comprehensive background and quality information for physicians and other healthcare practitioners. Applications often span 15 to 60 pages, placing a significant burden on practitioners. According to the Medical Group Management Association, each physician submits an average of 18 credentialing applications annually, with additional applications for non-physician providers.
